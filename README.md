# uu-ai-data-mining
Repository for the practical assignments expected for the Data Mining Elective @ Utrecht University, 1st Period. 

## Build Instructions:
We recommend using pyenv and poetry for virtual env management and package dependency management, respectively. 
Assuming those requirements are met and you're inside the repository's folder:
```
pyenv virtualenv <repo_name>   # this creates a new virtual env based on your pyenv global version
pyenv local <virtual_env_name>  # this specifies pyenv to use said virtualenv when inside the repo
poetry install # poetry installs the necessary dependencies
```

### Deadlines
- Assignment 1: Classification Trees and Random Forests - October 14th
- Assignment 2: Text Mining - November 4th
